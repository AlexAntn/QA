#### General rules for posting

- :memo: All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- :thinking: Post here **general questions**. Try to avoid reporting bugs and/or feature requests that are code specific; for this purpose, instead, rely on the issue tracking system of the relative repository \(e.g. [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp), [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...).
- :eyes: Before raising a new question, please check whether your problem has already found a possible solution by [**searching in the closed issues**](https://github.com/robotology/QA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
- :nut_and_bolt: Post on [**`icub-support`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-support) any request for robot maintenance (e.g. issues related to hardware and/or robot configuration files).
- :smirk: We try to be neat and thus we _aim_ to **close questions** that have found their answers.

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com), including instructions to run them.
