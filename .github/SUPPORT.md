#### General rules for posting

- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- To be able to apply **labels** to questions, ask maintainers to become a **collaborator**.
- Post here **general questions**. Try to avoid reporting bugs and/or feature requests that are code specific; for this purpose, instead, rely on the issue tracking system of the relative repository \(e.g. [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp), [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...).
- Before raising a new question, please check whether your problem has already found a possible solution by [**searching in the closed issues**](https://github.com/robotology/QA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
- Please, refrain from assigning the new issue to specific people since **triaging issues is a maintainers' task**.
- Post on [**`icub-support`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-support) any request for robot maintenance.
- We try to be neat and thus we _aim_ to **close questions** that have found their answers :smirk:.

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com), including instructions to run them.
