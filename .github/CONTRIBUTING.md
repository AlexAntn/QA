#### General rules for posting

- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- To be able to assign **labels** to questions, ask maintainers to become a **collaborator**.
- Post here **general questions**. Try to avoid reporting bugs and/or feature requests that are code specific; for this purpose, instead, rely on the issue tracking system of the relative repository \(e.g. [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp), [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...\).
- Post on [**`icub-support`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-support) any request for robot maintenance.
- We try to be neat and thus we _aim_ to **close questions** that have found their answers :smirk:.

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com), including instructions to run them.
